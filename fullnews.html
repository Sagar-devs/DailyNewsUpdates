                <p style="text-decoration: underline;">1. ‘Spy Camera’ found in Andhra Pradesh engineering college sets off protests, police inquiry</p>
                <p>A spy camera allegedly found in the washroom of a woman’s hostel at the Seshadri Rao Gudlavalleru College of Engineering in Andhra Pradesh’s Krishna has sparked protests, prompting a police investigation.</p>
                <p>Krishna district Superintendent of Police (SP) Gangadhar Rao, refused to confirm the existence of the spy camera at the Gudlavalleru college. But he said that a case was registered and investigations were ongoing. “Whether there was any camera hidden in the washroom of the women’s hostel will be determined after the investigation is over,” he said.</p>
                <p>This came after protests erupted among women students of the engineering college over the spy camera allegedly found in one of the washrooms. Protesters have alleged that footage from the camera has been circulated on social media groups, although this is yet to be confirmed.</p>
                <p>According to police sources, a final-year male student is being questioned. They also said that a team of investigators were at the men’s hostels of the college to search through laptops and mobile phones for any footage from the camera.</p>

                <p style="text-decoration: underline;">2. PM apologises for collapse of Shivaji statue in Maharashtra: ‘A deity for us’</p>
                <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi Friday apologised for the collapse of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj statue at the Rajkot Fort in Maharashtra’s Sindhudurg district, saying the Maratha ruler was “not just a king for me and my colleagues, but a figure highly revered and worshipped by all”. Modi was addressing a public gathering at Palghar, where he laid the foundation stone of the Vadhvan Port.</p>
                <p>“For me, my colleagues and everyone, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is not just a king. He is highly revered and worshipped. For us, he is our aaradhya dev (revered deity),” Modi said. “I also extend my apologies to all those who worship Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as their revered deity. I know their sentiments are hurt,” he added.</p>
                <p>Inaugurated by Modi on Navy Day on December 4 last year, the 35-ft Shivaji statue collapsed on August 26, leaving the state government red-faced.</p>
                <p>The collapse of the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj has sparked a war of words between ruling and Opposition parties in poll-bound Maharashtra. Initially, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde said the statue collapsed due to heavy winds along the shore. And Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had said the statue was built by the Navy, not the state government.</p>
                <p>With the initial response not going down well with the BJP’s central leadership, 48 hours later, Shinde said he would not mind “apologising a 1,000 times” for the incident.</p>
